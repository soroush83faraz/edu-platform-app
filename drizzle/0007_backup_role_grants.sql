-- Custom migration: make `pg_dump -U app_backup` possible.
--
-- pg_dump locks and reads EVERY table of the database, including drizzle.__drizzle_migrations, and app_backup had
-- no USAGE on schema `drizzle` ("permission denied for schema drizzle" before it dumped a single row). The second
-- half of the fix is role-level and cannot run as app_owner: `ALTER ROLE app_backup BYPASSRLS` (superuser) lives in
-- deploy/db/initdb/01-roles.sh for fresh installs and is an operator step on existing servers (deploy/README.md).
-- app_backup keeps SELECT-only grants, so BYPASSRLS widens what it can read, never what it can write.
